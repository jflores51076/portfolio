      <p>Scratch and python to me are very different because in scratch the boxes or actions are given to you as oppose to python where you have to search for the actions. Some similaritites are that although the boxes are not given to you, their is similar actions that scratch and python have like variables. </p>
      <h1 style="background-color:orange"> REFLECTION 6/30</h1>
      <p>A list is a series of variables. Lists are useful when wanting to name a series of variables. Today I learned how to have the computer randomly chose a variable from the list I created. I also learned about different things you can do with lists like slicing append and extend. Slicing works by giving you the position where the variable in the list lies.

     <p> My idea of robots did not necessarly change because I have never thought of a definition of a robot but instead it was made. I am scared of robots for the future only because I feel like humans will heavily depend on a robot and completely forget how to manage on their own. Working in a group really helped because I do not know anything about robotics. I feel like for next time I will contribute more because this time I did not do that just because I felt like I had nothing really to contribute to. </p>
      
      <h1 style="background-color:green">REFLECTION 7/6</h1>
      <p> Today was a succesful day because I feel like I contributed more than I did the first day of robotics; I think that I felt more comfortable with the people in my group so it was easier to interact with them and ask questions as opose to my group yesterday because I constantly felt that I was falling behind. I really liked today and I feel like I can actually make both a blinking light and a group of lights blink all at the same time.</p>
      
      <h1 style="background-color: blue"> REFLECTION 7/10</h1> 
      <p>Today was really fun only because I got to see how a robot can work and move throuhg just code. I learned about servo piezo and how piezo gives off sound throuhg frequencies. Working with a group was helpful because I was semi confused on what to do but after seeing my partners workm through I was more confident on my knowledge of the robot. </p>

      <h1> REFLECTION 7/17 </h1>
      <p> I think it is easy to find me on the inernet but I do not think that many people can find things about me just because I dont personal things but if it was for someone else it will. If it was a person that did post everyday and more personal things than people would be able to find more about them. Programmers can protect their content through breaking codes and providing security. Programmers can block any scams or troll accounts. </p>
      
      <h1> REFLETION 7/18 </h1> 
      <p> Well today was actually a pretty successful day. Learned about dictionaries, lists, and dataframe. We did not really use dataframes but we did use litsts and dictionaries. I feel more comfortable with dictionaries because I feel like I spent enough time on that one snd therefore feel more comfortable. Today we were doing a recipe and we put ingredients in a list and the intructions in a dictionary. Me and my group finished early and moved on to the extensions because we wanted to go beyond the limit. After, we learned more on the code and we did some more complicated code and through that I learned how you can display both the element and inner element without printing. In an extension, we put a list inside a list and diplayed both the element and innerelement. </p> 
      <h1> REFLECTION 7/19 </h1>
      <p> Since each of the work is pretty even, we are splitting up the work by the amount of work there is. For example, for the research there is two topics for each of us so we each take two topics and research on it. All the coding is also pretty even. There is 5 pages for out website so we can each do at least one page for each one of us and code the whole thing or at least our research part. We are going to stay on task on not drift off to other topics that do not relate to our project </p>
      <h1> REFLECTION 7/25 </h1>
      <p> I think one skill that I can build is being flexible because I know as for me, I have to have everything on check and how me and my group invision things. I can accept anything that does not go along with what we invision like if something suddenly goes wrong or we are behind. At the end of our project, I can see if I have accepted anything that went wrong.I am responsible for one tab in our webpage which deals with giving information about abuse. I will try my hardest not to get distracted in any way. </p>  
      <h1> REFLECTION 7/28 </h1>
      <p> I think I have been more flexibale with this project because I had a lot of failures this past week. I was not able to link all branches and I am strill working to put it, it is a work in progress. I put the tabs but it is not able to read it correctly just yet I have another idea I need to try and hopefully it works this time. I was able to work with half of our group gone on tuesday which was a surprise but I was able to manage and we actually got a lot donw without half of our group here. I think I like to work more on expanding our website because I think for my page at least, it is too simple pr easy and I want to add more if time pleases. </p>
