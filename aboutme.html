      <p>Scratch and python to me are very different because in scratch the boxes or actions are given to you as oppose to python where you have to search for the actions. Some similaritites are that although the boxes are not given to you, their is similar actions that scratch and python have like variables. </p>

      <p>A list is a series of variables. Lists are useful when wanting to name a series of variables. Today I learned how to have the computer randomly chose a variable from the list I created. I also learned about different things you can do with lists like slicing append and extend. Slicing works by giving you the position where the variable in the list lies.

     <p> My idea of robots did not necessarly change because I have never thought of a definition of a robot but instead it was made. I am scared of robots for the future only because I feel like humans will heavily depend on a robot and completely forget how to manage on their own. Working in a group really helped because I do not know anything about robotics. I feel like for next time I will contribute more because this time I did not do that just because I felt like I had nothing really to contribute to. </p>

      <p> Today was a succesful day because I feel like I contributed more than I did the first day of robotics; I think that I felt more comfortable with the people in my group so it was easier to interact with them and ask questions as opose to my group yesterday because I constantly felt that I was falling behind. I really liked today and I feel like I can actually make both a blinking light and a group of lights blink all at the same time.</p>
