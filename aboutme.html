      <h1> REFLECTION ON ROBOTS</h1>
      <p> My idea of robots did not necessarly change because I have never thought of a definition of a robot but instead it was made. I am scared of robots for the future only because I feel like humans will heavily depend on a robot and completely forget how to manage on their own. Working in a group really helped because I do not know anything about robotics. I feel like for next time I will contribute more because this time I did not do that just because I felt like I had nothing really to contribute to. </p>
